I currently am a second year student majoring in Pre-Business and hopefully by the time it is my third year, I will become an official Business Administration student with the concentration in information systems. I wanted to work in this field because I did not find any interest in other fields and I recall taking a class that was about business and a certain area dealing with data and information systems had caught my attention. I was interested in the lesson and partly was because of the professor but regardless of that, I still enjoyed it. Hello Everyone.
